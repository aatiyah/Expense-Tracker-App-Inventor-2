# Expense-Tracker-App-Inventor-2
A small Android App developed using MIT/Google's App Inventor 2.

I developed this Android Application as a graduation project for my Master's degree.

The App assists users keep track of their day-to-day expenses by managing their incomes, expenses, and review their balances at any time.

To check this out, you need to log-in to App Inventor's page with your Google account credentials. Then, you need to import the "ExpenseTracker.aia" file.

You can install the App on your Android device by installing and running the "ExpenseTracker.apk" file.
